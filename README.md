## Features

This repository houses _Pleuston_, the reference web app for consumers to explore, download, and publish data assets within the Ocean Protocol network.

- Connect to all required Ocean Protocol components: _Keeper_ & _Aquarius_
- Register and publish data assets
- Explore, buy, and download data assets

_Pleuston_ is a single page React app, initially bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but ejected from it.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >=8
- npm
- Ocean Protocol components
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io)

To start development with _Pleuston_ you first have to get all the other Ocean Protocol components up and running.

![ocean-components](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/47997856-97a01a80-e0fd-11e8-80da-15b1f1b68347.png)

The simplest way is to use our main script utilizing `docker-compose` from the [üê≥ docker-images](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/docker-images) repository, and pass the option to skip the _Pleuston_ image in there:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docker-images.git
cd docker-images/

./start_ocean.sh --no-pleuston --latest
```

This will start up all required components:

### [üêã aquarius](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius)

You now have a locally running _Aquarius_ backend application exposed under `http://localhost:5000`.

### [üíß keeper-contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts)

You now have a locally running RPC client with all the contracts from _keeper-contracts_ deployed to it, exposed under `http://localhost:8545`.

## Storage Providers

As of right now, _pleuston_ requires asset files to be stored in Azure Cloud Storage before registering them through the UI. For more convenience we will integrate connections to various cloud storage providers.

<img width="545" alt="screen shot 2019-02-12 at 12 47 42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/52633365-6c7b5300-2ec4-11e9-825c-e8bc65655812.png">

### AWS

App includes an Connection to Amazon Web Services, so you can retrieve and register assets stored in an S3 bucket. Setting AWS connection requires the setup of Cognito authentication service with proper Access-policies to specific bucket. Pleuston side configuration for AWS can be cound in [`config/cloudStorage.js`](config/cloudStorage.js)

### Azure Storage

App includes an OAuth connection to your Azure account. Once authorized, assets can be chosen from a file list within _pleuston_.

_Note: Currently, Azure Storage only allows listing containers with OAuth credentials. Listing blobs in containers and operations on blobs can't be done with OAuth credentials until [that feature is out of preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad). Until then, manually added credentials are required in [`config/cloudStorage.js`](config/cloudStorage.js)_

## Development

After the Docker containers from the above step are up, you can start your local development version of _Pleuston_:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/pleuston.git
cd pleuston/

npm i
npm start
```

This should output a message as follows:

```bash
Compiled successfully!

You can now view @oceanprotocol/pleuston in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000/
```

### MetaMask

Be sure to login into your MetaMask account and either select:

- the `Kovan` test network, or
- `Localhost 8545`

The latter will connect you to the RPC client running inside Docker.

### Production build

You can inspect a full production build by creating it first, and then run a local web server on top of the build output, e.g. [`serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve):

```bash
# create production build
npm run build

serve -s build/
# go to http://localhost:5000
```

### npm releases

For a new **patch release**, execute on the machine where you're logged into your npm account:

```bash
./bumpversion path

## Configuration

All required components to get _Pleuston_ running are pre-configured and started with the above `docker-compose` command, and the web app is configured to connect to them.

If you want to change and run _Pleuston_ against your own deployed components, head over to the [`config/ocean.js`](./config/ocean.js) file and modify the respective values.

To run your application over SSL, set the scheme values in [`config/ocean.js`](./config/ocean.js) to `https`:

```js
module.exports = {
    nodeScheme: 'http',
    nodeHost: 'localhost',
    nodePort: 8545,

    aquariusScheme: 'http',
    aquariusHost: 'localhost',
    aquariusPort: 5000,

    brizoScheme: 'https',
    brizoHost: 'localhost',
    brizoPort: 8030,

    parityScheme: 'http',
    parityHost: 'localhost',
    parityPort: 8545,

    secretStoreScheme: 'http',
    secretStoreHost: 'localhost',
    secretStorePort: 12001,

    secretStoreThreshold: 0,
    secretStorePassword: 'unittest',
    secretStoreAddress: '0xed243adfb84a6626eba46178ccb567481c6e655d'
}
```

## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `npm test`.

The tests run:

- linting checks with ESLint and Stylelint
- basic rendering tests for components with Jest

While code coverage status will be reported in the console and on Travis, coverage information won't be uploaded to Codacy for any Pull Request from a forked repo. That is because of a [security restriction in Travis](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/pull-requests/#pull-requests-and-security-restrictions).

## Code style

Code linting is setup with [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [stylelint](https://stylelint.io) following [eslint-config-oceanprotocol](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/eslint-config-oceanprotocol) and [stylelint-config-bigchaindb](https://github.com/bigchaindb/stylelint-config-bigchaindb).

There's a npm script setup which runs only linting tests:

```bash
npm run lint
```
